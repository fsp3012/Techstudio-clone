            I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior <br />
            knowledge in software development. However, within a few weeks,
            <br />
            I was able to grasp the crux of software development and also <br />
            master the soft skills required for being a software developer.
          </p>

          <p>
            So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing
            <br />
            push in my career as a software developer.

            Tech Studio Academy has been one of the big push I needed to get
            <br />
            in the real world space. I had an immense learning that was really
            <br />
            different from the self learning I started with. The learning was
            <br />
            fun and there were some internship job opportunities that were
            <br />
            presented to us. I got my first gig immediately after the program.

          <p>Thank you Tech Studio for that push I needed.</p>
